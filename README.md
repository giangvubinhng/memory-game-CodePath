## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   I've never done audio implementing in JavaScript so AudioContext was really new to me and I wasn't too sure of what each line under Page Initialization was supposed to do. However, after doing a bit of research and read an article from the link I attached on the above question.
   I was able to understand much more about AudioContext, as well as audio implementation in JavaScript.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I've never thought about audio implementation before while learning web development until I got to work on this project! It made me wonder why I've never thought of this and also made me really curious about
   sound systems in web development. I also wonder what are the other things in web development that I've not thought of.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   It happened to be my mid term week so I didn't have much time to spend on this project. However, if I had more time to work on this project, I would definitely love to complete all of the optional features.
